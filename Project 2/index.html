						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>About me:</strong> I am currently working for two years at Takealot as a product lister. Takealot is an e-commerce site and the biggest e-commerce site in South Africa. As a product lister, I'm responsible for making our products the best among competitors. I handle multiple stores, making our products show up first when you search for them. As a part of the job, I also organized some products in spreadsheets, placed competitors, and identified product prices that needed to be changed. I also trained five product listers, who are currently working for us. Utilizing Adobe Photoshop for the pictures that need to be uploaded and listed.

								I'm currently a 2nd-year college student studying Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering, and I took the ICT strand when I was in senior high school. I am proficient in programming languages like Java, Python, and HTML. Especially Java, which I have been using for 4 years now. I also have background knowledge of JavaScript, SQL, and Android Studio. I also developed an application, which was our project in grade 12.</p>
